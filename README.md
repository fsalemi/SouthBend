# City of South Bend District Information

## Objectives
This is a repository for code and data needed for South Bend Districts Information application. The application is designed to be a quick reference for South Bend leadership, businesses and district representatives to gather a variety of information, which will help them in their areas of interest. By loading several different datasets, I will allow them to quickly identify nearby features including schools, public facilities, and other nearby attractions. By generating a series of maps, this will quickly represent visually what would otherwise take months of prep work.  Additionally, another goal is to allow the Mayor of South Bend to be able to see how these datasets can be used in conjunction with each other in a way that makes more sense than examining the raw data.
